Documentation of my Chess Engine Experiments
============================================

This project documents my experiments with creating chess engines for game evaluation and the creation of chess bots.
There is no real aim to this project so don't expect anything.
The project is inspired by the book `Neural Networks for Chess <https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01506>`_ by Dominik Klein.
